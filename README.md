# Hey, there

Have a â˜• while you are here.

This is an organization I, @kelvintaywl, use to house CircleCI-related samples.

I tend to use this for sharing sample projects and investigations for my own curiosity, and for sharing with customers.

In general, all repositories here are public by default, and I attempt to keep them generic (and secrets-free).
